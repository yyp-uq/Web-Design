            Link is the courageous protagonist of The Legend of Zelda series, often chosen by destiny to wield the Master Sword and protect the kingdom of Hyrule. 
            Though he rarely speaks, his bravery, sense of justice, and unwavering determination have made him a timeless hero across generations. 
            He frequently embarks on perilous quests to rescue Princess Zelda and battle the forces of evil, especially the dark lord Ganon.

            Ganondorf is the primary antagonist in many Zelda games, a powerful sorcerer and king of the Gerudo tribe who seeks the Triforce to gain ultimate power. 
            Driven by ambition and darkness, he often returns in different forms—most notably as the monstrous Ganon—to plunge Hyrule into chaos. 
            He is Link's eternal rival and a symbol of corruption and imbalance.
